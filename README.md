# Hunter Ball <sub>(They/She)</sub>
ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I am a developer and designer focused on simple, accessible, and functional software and web solutions. I have a passion for user experience and open source projects, and I am always looking for new projects to help out with.
I am also a junior within the University of Arizona's Computer Science program.
